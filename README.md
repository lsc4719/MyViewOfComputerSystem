A view from a process within a Linux system towards the world.  
Dotted arrow means dependencies. [1]

![Diagram: A view from a process within a Linux system towards the world. A process leverages devices via abstractions provided by the kernel.](https://github.com/lsc4719/MyViewOfComputerSystem/blob/main/process-view-0.drawio.svg)


### motivation

This is not a complete picture of linux system.  
There are much more other capabilities in the linux system.  
The reason why I draw this picture is, I am the kind of person who cannot go forward without knowing something enough.  
For example, when I was in university, I took my first programming course with C++.  
I denied to write code before reading cplusplus.com's tutorial.  
I am the kind of person who cannot do something without undestand something(or w/o belief of myself).
